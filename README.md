# Explanation Summary (ExSum)

## Overview

The explanation summary (ExSum) framework is a mathematical formalization to quantatively represent and evaluate generalized model understandings derived from local explanations, introduced in the NAACL 2022 paper. This package implements a GUI for the construction and evaluation of generalized model understandings for natural language processing (NLP) models. 

## Usage

This package can be installed via `pip install exsum`. To get started, please refer to the [documentation](https://yilunzhou.github.io/exsum/documentation.html) for more details.
